# Memory Game Project

## Project 2

A memory card game written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Instructions for Play

16 cards, 8 matching pairs, are randomly distributed on the screen. Click or touch to cards to flip them over and see if they match. Try to match all the cards by successively clicking on cards to find a match. Only two cards will be revealed at once.

A timer starts when the first card is selected. Each pair of flipped cards counts as one move and moves are counted and tallied to affect star rating. 

When all the matches are made a congratulatory window will popup and announce the time taken, moves, and star rating. You will also have the option to play again. 

A reset option is available on the scoreboard to start a new game.
